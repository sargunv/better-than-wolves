# Better Than Wolves

This repository is a reupload of the source code [posted by the author on the BTW forum](https://sargunster.com/btwforum/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=9863). It's here simply for archival and ease of browsing. This repository will not host any form of active development.

The source code is intended to work with a version of MCP 7.51 for MC 1.5.2.

The only modifications from the original download are:
1. The inclusion of the full license text at the root of the repo.
2. The inclusion of a `.editorconfig` file to set GitHub to display the source code with the appropriate indents.
3. The inclusion of this `README.md` file.

The original `Readme.txt` is as follows:
